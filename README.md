# Project Timer

This project will feature a **timer** that employs the **Pomodoro Technique**. 

## Purpose

It can be hard to remain focused throughout the day when you have to allocate a large amount of time towards a specific project or schoolwork. This application serves to provide timers that can break up that time into intervals of focused working/studying and short breaks. As these timers are completed they will be recorded and you will be able to visualize time spent. 

I am interested in this project as I have used similar applications before, but I have found that they do not let you thoroughly visualize and analyze time spent.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo and it is a time management method. Briefly put, this technique involves dedicating **25 minutes of concentrated and focused work**, followed by a **short 5 minute break**. After 4 cycles have been completed, you should then take a **long break, 20-30 minutes**.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to name and create a new task (ex. CPSC210) and add it to a project (ex. School)
- As a user, I want to be able to start, pause and complete a 25 minute timer, followed by a 5 minute break for a selected task. If 4 cycles have been completed, I want the option to start a long break.
- As a user, I want the option to add tags to each individual timer session, ex. (Term project, midterm1, final), to further specify time spent within a task.
- As a user I want to be able to abruptly end a work timer and still have time recorded
- As a user, I want to be able to modify the default timer durations. For example 25 min -> 40 min of focused work, and 5 min -> 10 min for breaks.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all of my current tasks and time spent on each
- As a user, I want to see a visual breakdown of my tasks, such as pie charts (breakdown of individual project time) and bar graphs (x-axis date, y-axis time spent)
